# Neighborhood Data

Answering questions from a neighorhood perspective.

The goal of this project is to answer questions about neighborhoods with open data sources, as well as provide an open source model for data ingestion and analyses.

This is very much a work in progress. The initial quesiton is, which neighborhoods in Philadelphia receive the quickes resolutions to 311 service. This might be expressed in a dashboard or report card. Next steps would be to compare that to demographic and income data from the census to see if there are any trends.

Further questions and answers will be added in the future.
